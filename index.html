    Hey guys, since it's been some time since I started this car hobby and
    I've reached my goals a while ago I decided to make a build thread.
    When I first had my SC I had been searching around on Club Lexus for some
    inspiration and knowledge. While I was still in high school my brother was
    in the VIP scene with his GS430 at the time. I thought it was awesome that
    this new style had come to be and I wanted to join in.
